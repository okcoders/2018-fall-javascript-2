# 2018 Fall Javascript 2

In this course we hope to become comfortable with the bulk of the javascript
language from the black box perspective. As in, here are all the things
javascript understands (functions, strings, numbers, looping, etc.), without
getting into how it understands.

Once there we will look into the box a little bit in order to understand how
programs are executed.

Finally, we will simulate building a more complicated application, and go
through four important things programmers do often

* fix bugs
* add features
* refactor
* make other programmers happy (all the little things, like well documented,
  clean, logged, monitored, and tested programs)

## Our complicated application

We will build an app that facilitates the [make time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078QSCM3V/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) philosphy of productivity. So yes, another to-do app, but with a little extra :)

The requirements for this program include:
* making a list of high level priorities, and being able to arrange them in
  priority order
* making a to-do list for a particular day, and tagging a to-do item to signify
  allignment with a particular high level priority
* reflection notes for particular days (meant to be filled in at the end of a
  day)

I will provide a prototype of this application. And the classes will be as
follows:

* day 1 I show that there is a bug in the prototype, you must find and fix the bug
* day 2 I request a new feature be added to the application
* day 3 I show that there is another new feature we need, but to add it we
  should really refactor our existing code to better facilitate it
* day 4 I show how to tie a pretty bow around our application, and you modify it
  to look how you think it should look
